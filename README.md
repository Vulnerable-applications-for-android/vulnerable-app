# Vulnerable App

 Vulnerable Android app used for testing purposes. 
 It is divided into "rules" which are taken from some Google textual guidelines. Each "rule" represents a specific vulnerability, which is briefly described in each fragment container in the app.
 Those "rules" were originally exctracted by the [SPRITZ Researce Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/) and used for [SPECK](https://github.com/SPRITZ-Research-Group/SPECK).
